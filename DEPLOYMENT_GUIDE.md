## 🌍 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Keep Running Locally (Current Setup)
**Best for:** Development and testing

**How to access:**
1. Open terminal
2. Run: `npm start`
3. Open browser: http://localhost:3000
4. Share with others on same network: http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:3000

**Pros:**
- ✅ Free
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ No deployment needed

**Cons:**
- ❌ Only accessible on your computer/network
- ❌ Stops when you close terminal
- ❌ Not accessible from internet

---

### Option 2: Deploy to Render.com (Recommended for Production)
**Best for:** Making it accessible online for free

**Steps:**

1. **Create Render Account**
   - Go to https://render.com
   - Sign up with GitHub

2. **Create MongoDB Atlas (Free)**
   - Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
   - Create free cluster
   - Get connection string (copy it)

3. **Deploy on Render**
   ```
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repo: Benjamin1219-glitch/BrickNgo
   - Settings:
     * Name: brickngo
     * Build Command: npm install
     * Start Command: npm start
     * Environment: Node
   - Add Environment Variables:
     * MONGODB_URI = (paste your Atlas connection string)
     * SESSION_SECRET = any random string
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   ```

4. **Access Your Site**
   - Your site will be at: `https://brickngo.onrender.com`
   - Takes 2-3 minutes to deploy

**Pros:**
- ✅ Free tier available
- ✅ Accessible worldwide
- ✅ Auto-deploys from GitHub
- ✅ Supports Node.js natively
- ✅ Free MongoDB (Atlas)

---

### Option 3: Deploy to Railway (Also Free)
**Best for:** Quick deployment with database included

**Steps:**

1. Install Railway CLI:
```powershell
npm install -g railway
```

2. Login and deploy:
```powershell
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

3. Add MongoDB:
```powershell
railway add
# Select: MongoDB
```

4. Your site will be live at a Railway URL

**Pros:**
- ✅ Very fast deployment
- ✅ Built-in MongoDB option
- ✅ Free tier ($5/month credit)
- ✅ Auto SSL certificates

---

### Option 4: Netlify (Static Site Only)
**Not recommended** for this project because:
- ❌ Netlify is for static sites
- ❌ Your app needs a Node.js server running
- ❌ Would require complex serverless conversion
- ❌ MongoDB connection more difficult

**Alternative:** Deploy static files to Netlify + backend to Render

---

## 🔧 Environment Variables

For deployment, you'll need:

```env
# MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/building_materials

# Session Secret (random string)
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-random-key-here

# Port (usually set by hosting platform)
PORT=3000
```

---

## 📱 Make Accessible on Your Network

To share with others on same WiFi:

1. **Find your local IP:**
```powershell
ipconfig
# Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
```

2. **Update server.js:**
```javascript
app.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://0.0.0.0:3000');
});
```

3. **Share URL with others:**
   - You: http://localhost:3000
   - Others: http://192.168.1.100:3000 (use your actual IP)
