I can deploy it for you right now! Just confirm and I'll run:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### For Full Functionality:
Your app needs a backend server for:
- Shopping cart
- User login/signup
- Database operations
- Order processing

**Netlify Limitation:**
- Netlify hosts static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- Backend features require serverless functions or external hosting

### Recommended Setup:

**Option A: Static Site on Netlify (Limited)**
- ‚úÖ Fast and free
- ‚úÖ Works for browsing products
- ‚ùå No cart, login, or database

**Option B: Frontend on Netlify + Backend on Render (Recommended)**
1. Deploy static files to Netlify (what we're doing now)
2. Deploy Node.js backend to Render.com (free)
3. Connect them via API calls

**Option C: Full App on Render (Simplest)**
- Deploy entire app to Render.com
- Get URL like: `https://brickngo.onrender.com`
- Everything works (cart, login, database)

## Quick Deploy Now

Want me to deploy it now? Just say "yes" and I'll deploy your site to:
**https://brickngo-shop.netlify.app**

The site will show your homepage and products, but backend features will need Render.com setup.

## Your Site URL

Once deployed, share this link:
### üåê https://brickngo-shop.netlify.app
